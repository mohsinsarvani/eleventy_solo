This is just for the Vercel test. We're keeping the images in here to make sure they still work as they should under the Vercel build process.

First, the AltaMail image . . .

{% lazypicture "AltaMail-iPhone-dark--FavsInBox_edit_1125x2436.jpg", "AltaMail “Favorites” inbox view" %}

Then, the Preside image . . .

{% lazypicture "Preside-iPhone-dark--All-Inboxes-20200504-0951-1.jpg", "Preside “All Inboxes” view" %}

And now a code block of sorts . . .

```html
<html>

  <h1>This is an H1 heading</h1>

  <p>And this is a paragraph.</p>

</html>
```

Finally, the last image . . .

{% lazypicture "Preside-iPad-light--Inboxes-20200514-0932_edit_2048x1536.jpg", "Preside, as it appears in “light mode” on the iPad" %}

From here, we're just spending time.

Hello, one, two, three.
